Quine-McCluskey Logic Minimizer in C++

An attempt to implement an efficient Logic Minimizer by sparing as much time and space as possible.


-Reads the minterms of a logic function of up to 16 variables 

-Prints the essential prime implicants, the first and last stage of the implication table

-Prints the first stage of the second step of the Quine-McCluskey tabular method (the graph)

Note: this program uses the Quine-McCluskey method for Decimal notation.
